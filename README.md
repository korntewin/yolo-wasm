# üöÄ Overview

>üî• Simple Web application for YOLOv8 Object Detection using **React + Rust's WebAssembly**!  
> üßë‚Äçüíª The web application demo is hosted at <a href="https://yolo.crypto-bot-gcp.trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> yolo.crypto-bot-gcp.trade </a> you can try it out! or you can run the source code locally.

The web application is run & rendered purely on client-side üñ•Ô∏è without transferring any data out to the public internet, so no need to worry! 

The YOLOv8 model is backed by Rust programming language compiled into WebAssembly üéâ which is imported and modified from üïØÔ∏è[candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) repository. Below is the example of webapp:

_Note that, the web app has the most performance on firefox!_

# Get started locally
1. cd into project directory root and run `npm install` to install all of the required React pacakge
2. run `npm run build:wasm` to build webassembly artifact  
3. run `npm run start` to test locally 
4. run `npm run build` to build the deployable artifact

# Architecture for the web application
Below is the simple architecture for this web application:
1. Users will access the domain hosted on **Cloudflare**
2. The request will be routed through **Cloudflare infra** and proxied to **AWS Cloudfront**
3. **AWS Cloudfront**, then, will fetch the website content from **AWS S3** into users' browser
4. HTML, Javascript, and WASM will be rendered at users' browser for real time Object Detection with the following as a main components:  
    4.1 **Candle** ML Framework in *Rust* compiled to **WebAssembly** as a main inference engine  
    4.2 **Yolo v8** as the main Obeject Detection Model  
    4.2 **React** as a main rendering UI  
    4.3 **react-webcam** for streaming video frame from webcam

# Limitation
1. Currently Candle doesn't support WebGPU on wasm yet, the Yolo is inferenced purely on a single CPU core.
2. As a result, the smallest Yolo (nano version) is implemented in the web application and will not have high accuracy!
